# Assorted Biscuits

Use assorted-biscuits to make code soup and spaghetti more digestible. Annotate ALL the end brackets!!!

Watch the text by the end brackets to see Biscuits in action.

Note: The explosion you see is [Power Mode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoovercj.vscode-power-mode)

## Supported Languages

Assorted Biscuits is named as such because it handles multiple languages. This functionality is provided by [Tree Sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).

- C
- C#
- Elm
- Go
- Java
- JSON
- Kotlin
- Lua
- PHP
- Python
- Rust
- TOML
- YAML

We can add more as their grammars are made available as WebAssembly.

## Roadmap

Until we can bring HTML, SCSS, and TS into this repo, we will continue to maintain those other extensions seperately.

## Warning! Potential Plugin Conflict

In the current implementation, code-biscuits prevent seeing GitLens annotations. Issue can be tracked here:
[https://github.com/code-biscuits/html-biscuits/issues/2](https://github.com/code-biscuits/html-biscuits/issues/2)

The HTML extension getting fixed will be the blueprint for fixing other extensions in the same way.

## Global Configuration

- `assorted-biscuits.annotationColor` _string_ : Determines the color of annotation. Accepts any valid CSS color string.

  - default: `vscode.ThemeColor("editorLineNumber.foreground")`,

- `assorted-biscuits.annotationPrefix` _string_ : Determines beginning of the annotation text. Emoji are allowed. Empty string is also acceptable.

  - default: `"// "`,

- `assorted-biscuits.annotationMinDistance` _number_ : Determines the minimum amount of lines between start and end tag used to decide to show the annotations.

  - default: `0`,

- `assorted-biscuits.annotationMaxLength` _number_ : What is the longest annotation you should see before we cut it off with a `...`? A `0` value shows the full string.
  - default: `42`,

- `assorted-biscuits.languageSettings` _object_: Per-language configuration to allow each language to feel unique. See "Language Specific Configuration" below.

## Language Specific Configuration

You can configure each setting above to be specific to each language. To do so, use `cmd + shift + p` to bring up the VSCode command pallette. Search for "Configure Individual Language Settings". Using the command will show a webview UI.

The settings above will take precedent over the global settings when using that specific language.

You can also just use the settings.json to modify language settings:
```

  "assorted-biscuits.languageSettings": {
    "rust": {
      "annotationPrefix": "ü¶Ä ",
      "annotationMaxLength": "10",
      "annotationMinDistance": "1",
      "annotationColor": "#97f684"
    },
    "php": {
      "annotationPrefix": "üêò ",
      "annotationColor": "#ff0000",
      "annotationMaxLength": "4",
      "annotationMinDistance": "1"
    }
  }
```

We do our best to validate your per-language configuration if you decide to edit it manually.
